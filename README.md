# Auger-Data-analysis
Storage of some data-analysis code in order to understand the auger UHECR data.

The data is taken from the Pierre Auger observatory's website and is included with the code for analysing the data.
I have commented out the code which shows the directions of the possible UHECR sources in order to avoid clutter.
